#My prototype Pig Latin Translator app
This is an app that takes user input as a sentence and translates,
it into Pig Latin.

#Running the app
Just click on the .exe file and a GUI interface,
window should pop up and then fill in the details.

#Extra details
This is the first version/prototype of this program,
with time i will improve the interface and documentation and files
